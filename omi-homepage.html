      <div class="q1">Where were you born?</div>
      <div class="a1">"I was born in Lagos, Nigeria. <br>I lived there till the age of 6. <br>
        Then I moved to Ireland with my mother, sister and soon to be brother. <br>
        Mom did all the moving. We watched telly mostly... <br>
        Fastforward a whole bunch; throw in a few life changing <br>
        adventures/encounters; and <i>voile</i> here I am. <br>
        25 and living in Newcastle."</div>
      <div class="q2">When did you start playing the guitar?</div>
      <div class="a2">"I was 19, in my second year of university and bored. <br>Quite bored.<br>
      I also play the drums pretty fluently, y'know.<br>
      A lot of my songs were birthed behind a drum kit. <br>
      Not to sound pretentious or anything"</div>
      <div class="q3">What's your favourite movie?</div>
      <div class="a3">"Jumper." <br>
        "I know you didn't ask but my faourite movie snack <br>
        is mashed potatoes" <br> "Like.. really creamy mash." <br>
        "yeah."</div>
      <div class="q4">What's the last thing that made you cry?</div>
      <div class="a4">"hmm" <br>
      "Realising my insignificance slash impermanence(in the grand scheme of things)" <br>
      "That my love of attention and constant performance stem from a place of insecurity <br>
      and a deep yearning for acceptance. <br>
      Having to look at myself honestly and realising that it's dangerous <br>
      to always see yourself as the 'good gal or guy' <br>
      because no one is fully good or bad. <br> Bit of a humbling realisation.
      <br> It all happened at 6am in the middle of a field in Suffolk."</div>
      <div class="q5">Okay.. <br> er... <br>Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee?</div>
      <div class="a5">"Ip man." <br>
      "Next question."</div>
