      target="_blank">Kyotodaigakuigakubufuzoku Clinics</a>, Japan and met <br>
    Gray whlie on a scholarship internship in Haiti. The two married in a ficticious year at a mystically made up Cathedral in paris. <br>
    They moved to Manhattan in early 19blablabla as a result of the nature of his father's job. <br>
    His grandmother May Grey flew in from Taiwan to be with her daughter and named the boy Blackard Richtea Suitson. <br>
    She believed he was destined for greatness and was sure a powerful name would solidify his destiny. <br>

  </p>
  <p>
Suitson spent his early childhood travelling all around the world due to the nature of his fathers work. <br>
Never the less, he was able to enjoy a happy childhood with parents who were openly loving to one another <br>
and fiercely supportive of their children. Blackard got his first musical Instrument at the  age of 5. <br>
It was a <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiHkeXX0sXnAhWEse0KHf1eDIMYABAAGgJkZw&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQOD2OQRD6vOb86XEBo8rCMML9-q-Q-7hgSH8RGxkr9X0TKw0_5Mk2Y50qHgwFgYq89ZTAZQV88gMSckxkjwoNTY&sig=AOD64_0p0tEght3MFC6UEMel9qYZU2-lTQ&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjaoN7X0sXnAhUwVBUIHQ4RDukQ0Qx6BAgPEAE&adurl=" target="_blank">Yamaha Keyboard.</a>
His mother enthusiastically heired a home tutor. <br> Sadly his relationship with the instrument never developed past a casual hobby. <br>
He took a liking to the harp at the age of 9 after being exposed to it's tonal depths at church on sundays. <br>
His passion for this instrument burned on sowly through his teens even though he never owned one himself untill the age of 22. <br>

  </p>

  <p>
    He schooled in Neworleans for four years. There he was exposed to a whirlwind of cultures, ideas and mind expanding drugs. <br>
    Many believe this period is where his true potential was unlocked. <br>
    He took a keen interest in books on the mind and geo politics. It is believed that it is within this mixing pot of fresh ideas <br>
    Blackard began endorsing and nurturing the idea of the limitless potential of the mind when discipline is applied.

    <h4><strong>Love life</strong></h4> <br>
    Blackard was independent from an early age. He moved just after his sixteenth birthday. <br>
    first destination, Jacksonville Mississippy. He was fascinated with the idea of being able to <br>
    own a single pair of denim jeans for life and so he followed his gut instincts. <br>
    He got work at a local textile factory and very quickly moved up the ranks due to his <br>
    inquisitive nature and self confidence.
   </p>
   <p>
     A year into his time at the factory. He was in charge of four of the main five channels of <br>
     distribution within the company. On his 18th birthday the head of the factory invited him round for <br>
     dinner. This is where he met his first love, Joset Longly. The two fell for eachother almost immediately <br>
     and before long they were dating. <br>
   </p>

   <p>
     Blackard and Joset were inseparable. They got engaged after five years and were <br> married in Petersberg Cathedral a year later.
     On a tragic night at a specific date and time, according to our cultural perception of time; Joset suffered <br>
     a serious head injury after being hit by an avocado that was accidentlly dropped from the 45th floor of Manhattan building. <br>
     Suitson was never quite the same after the passing of Joset. They had no kids together but nonetheless, her passing <br>
     did some irreversable damage. Through the years Blackard never did get that close to anyoe like he had done with Joset

  <h4><strong>Career</strong></h4>
  This dude left the textile industry at the age of 20 and refound his love of music. <br>
  He moved to Berlin with his then partner Joset. There he discovered <a href="https://g.co/kgs/Fsfv7M" target="_blank" >Techno</a> and <a href="https://g.co/kgs/v68J27" target="_blank">Acid House</a> <br>
  After the death of his wife his music turned more somber. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZsXcc_tC-o" target="_blank" >Sad song</a> is a perfect example of this shift in style. <br>
  He progressed through various genres infusing different styles in a way completely unique to him. <br>

</p>
<p>
  He took an interest in computer programmoing...
